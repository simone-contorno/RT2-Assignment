1. Making a formal statement
Null hypothesis H_0: my_robot_time >= prof_robot_time
Alternative hypothesis H_a = my_robot_time < prof_robot_time

2. Select a significance level
Since there will be conduct 5 rounds for each map configuration, which
will be 4, there will be 20 samples of data for each robot. Then, the
significance level is set to 5%, this means that I expect only one sample 
to be out of the range of data (e.g. the robot turns in the wrong direction).

3. Deciding the distribution to use
Since the data are few, the whole set is considered; then, I choice to use the
normal distribution.

4. Selecting a random sample and computing appropriate values
Perform the experiment.
